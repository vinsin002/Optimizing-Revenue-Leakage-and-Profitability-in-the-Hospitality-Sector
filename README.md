# Optimizing Revenue Leakage and Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

In the highly competitive hospitality industry, understanding patterns of revenue leakage and opportunities to maximize profitability is critical. This project provides a data-driven approach to identify, analyze, and mitigate revenue losses while improving operational and financial efficiency.

Using Power BI for interactive visualization, alongside Python-based data analysis, we uncover insights from occupancy trends, booking behavior, customer segmentation, and pricing strategies to support informed decision-making.

## ðŸ§© Files Included

- `Dashboard.pbix` â€“ Power BI source file for the interactive dashboard.
- `Dashboard.pdf` â€“ Snapshot of the dashboard.
- `ppt.pdf` â€“ Presentation summarizing key findings and recommendations.
- `trend_analysis.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook for analyzing trends in occupancy, revenue, and customer behavior.
- `visualization_analysis.ipynb` â€“ Notebook with EDA and visual storytelling.
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation.

## ðŸ§  Key Objectives

- Identify revenue leakage areas in hotel operations.
- Analyze trends in booking patterns and cancellations.
- Evaluate room category performance and seasonal variations.
- Recommend pricing and booking strategy improvements.
- Visualize KPIs such as Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Occupancy Rate.

## ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** â€“ For building interactive dashboards and KPI tracking.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** â€“ For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For documenting the analytical workflow.
- **PDF & PPT** â€“ For sharing insights and reports.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Certain room categories consistently underperform due to poor pricing strategies.
- Peak booking windows are not fully capitalized on due to inventory mismanagement.
- Customer churn is higher during low seasons, indicating a need for loyalty programs and promotions.
- Dynamic pricing and optimized occupancy strategies can improve RevPAR by up to 12%.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

- Implement dynamic pricing using forecast models.
- Focus marketing on profitable customer segments during off-peak seasons.
- Improve booking experience and reduce cancellations by offering flexible policies.
- Track performance with real-time dashboards for proactive decision-making.
