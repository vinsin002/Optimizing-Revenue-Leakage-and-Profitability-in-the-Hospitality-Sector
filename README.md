# Optimizing Revenue Leakage and Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

## 1. Project Overview

In the highly competitive hospitality industry, understanding patterns of revenue leakage and opportunities to maximize profitability is critical. This project provides a data-driven approach to identify, analyze, and mitigate revenue losses while improving operational and financial efficiency.

Using Power BI for interactive visualization, alongside Python-based data analysis, we uncover insights from occupancy trends, booking behavior, customer segmentation, and pricing strategies to support informed decision-making.
